# BankAccount
Bank Account Project 
This Project is a challenge Ive been working on during the Spring 2020 Semester.
I did this project to advance my C++ skills and learn more about OOP

It incorporates many C++ concepts such as
-Object Oriented Programming
-Operator Overloading
-Inheritence 
-Polymorphism 
-and all of the basic C++ material such as functions,arrays,pointers,etc...
